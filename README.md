## Getting Started

Here are some of the things you must do to get started with this workshop:

### Software Prerequisites

- **This workshop uses the Python programming language.** If you do not already have Python installed on your computer, install the latest version for your operating system [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- This workshop will also use JupyterLab to run Jupyter Notebooks (with Python). Learn how to install JupyterLab [here](https://jupyter.org/install).

- This workshop heavily uses the `beautifulsoup4` package for Python. To install this, create a new cell in your JupyterLab Notebook file and type the following command:
    ```bash
    !pip install beautifulsoup4
    ```

    Running that cell in JupyterLab should install this package for you.
    
- This workshop also heavily uses the `requests` package for Python. This package *should* already be installed when you install JupyterLab, but if it isn't, create a new cell in your JupyterLab Notebook file and type the following command:
    ```bash
    !pip install requests
    ```

    Running that cell in JupyterLab should install this package for you.
